My name is Joshua Grady.

While this website has actually been around for a few years now, I've been using it almost exclusively as a way to tinker with basic web development. However, thanks to a recent urge to start writing, I decided to repurpose it into a blog. Most of the topics here will be related to tech with an emphasis on the experience of using primarily Apple products.

I've been using the name **nograsswillgrow** across the Internet for as long as I can remember, and since I'm terrible at naming new things, I decided to make it the name for my blog as well. At least _for now_.

I'll probably break this blog regularly since I don't always know what I'm doing.
