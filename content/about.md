Hi, my name is Joshua Grady. While I've been tinkering around with a basic static HTML website for a few years now, I wanted to setup a cleaner blog in which I could more cleanly push out content. My blog posts will generally be tech-related with a likely emphasis on Apple's ecosystem and products.

I've been using the name "nograsswillgrow" across the Internet for as long as I can remember, and since I'm terrible at naming things, I decided to make it the name for my blog as well. At least for now.

This site is hosted via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).
