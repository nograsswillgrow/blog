# üëãüèª

My name is Joshua Grady.

While this website has actually been around for a few years now, I've been using it almost exclusively as a way to tinker with basic web development. However, thanks to a recent urge to start writing, I decided to repurpose it into a blog. Most of the topics here will be related to tech with an emphasis on the experience of using primarily Apple products.

I've been using the name **nograsswillgrow** across the Internet for as long as I can remember, and since I'm terrible at naming new things, I decided to make it the name for my blog as well. At least _for now_.

This site was made with [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/) and is hosted using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). The theme was designed by [panr](https://twitter.com/panr). This entire blog is essentially work in progress until forever.
